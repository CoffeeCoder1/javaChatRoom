# Getting Started

You will need a server to connect to. If you do not, [host one](HostingAServer.md).

To connect to a server, you will first need to open a terminal, -or just run the JARfile- (Lanterna based gui coming soon, but running it without a terminal will not give any output currently).

Usage:
java -jar javaChatRoomClient.jar <Hostname (default is `localhost`)> <Port (default is `8022`)>
